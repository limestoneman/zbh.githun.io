<p>Hello! My name is Bihao Zhang (张 比豪), a senior ME undergrad at the University of Sciecne and Technology of China.</p>
<p>I am passionate about robotics, and I am interested in robotics system design, including mechanical design and dedicated controls.</p>
<p>I enjoy reasearch because I can explore new ideas, then explain or generalize them with theories.</p>
<p>My dream is to become a full-stack roboticist researcher, and develop new forms of robots.</p>
<p>Outside of work and study, I enjoy nature, movies, plotting things with Matlab, browsing through art feeds and doodling.</p>
<p>The page is still under construction. More content incoming！</p>
